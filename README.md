# ReactJS_Tweet_demo
Twitter Tweet box demo using ReactJS

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Twitter tweet has limited characters. This demo attempts to replicate the tweet box, implementing in ReactJS. Maximum character is set to 30.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>When you enter a character everytime, <code>onChange</code> event is triggered. If the string is more than 30 characters, it will be sliced.</p>

<p>Another section below the text area tells user how many characters are left.</p>
